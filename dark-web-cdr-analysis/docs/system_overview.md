## System Architecture
This system is designed to analyze dark web activity and Call Detail Records (CDRs) for threat detection.

### Components:
1. **Backend (FastAPI)** - Handles data processing and AI analysis.
2. **Frontend (React.js)** - Provides a user interface.
3. **Crawler (Scrapy)** - Extracts data from dark web.
4. **CDR Analysis** - Analyzes call logs for anomalies.
5. **ML Models** - Uses AI for NLP, sentiment analysis, and anomaly detection.
6. **Security** - Implements encryption and threat detection.
7. **Deployment** - Supports Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD.
